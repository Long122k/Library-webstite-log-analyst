It s tricky business, all these interlopers running about Thornfield, and deceptions run rampant as their paths cross with Jane, Rochester, and Miss Fairfax. Can Thursday save Jane Eyre and Bronte s masterpiece? And what of the Crimean War? Will it ever end?

But, with happiness finally within her grasp, and precious loved ones to protect, Grace is at her most vulnerable--in danger of losing everything to a vicious tabloid press and an enemy from her past, an enemy bent on malice at all costs.With rare insight and power, Danielle Steel writes this extraordinary woman s story, portraying her struggle to triumph over malice and betrayal, and to transform a lifetime of pain into a blessing for others. Revealing both the stark reality of domestic abuse and the healing power of love, Malice, is more than superb fiction. It is a piece of life.',15.01,'2004-01-27 00:00:00','Random House Large Print','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387712541l/278129.jpg'),('03ac7fea-9087-4b32-8227-ba50e4b03d6f','No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II','Doris Kearns Goodwin',NULL,NULL,'Winner of the Pulitzer for History, No Ordinary Time is a chronicle of one of the most vibrant & revolutionary periods in US history.

Gutzman',NULL,NULL,'“Let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.”—Thomas JeffersonThe United States Constitution—the bedrock of our country, the foundation of our federal republic—is . . . dead. You won’t hear that from the politicians who endlessly pay lip service to the Constitution. It’s the dirty little secret that bestselling authors Thomas E. Woods Jr. and Kevin R. C. Gutzman expose in this provocative new book. The fact is that government officials—Democrats and Republicans, presidents, judges, and congresses alike—long ago rejected the idea that the Constitution possesses a fixed meaning limiting the U.S. government’s power. In case you’ve forgotten, this idea was not a minor aspect of the Constitution; it was the document’s very purpose. Woods and Gutzman round up the suspects responsible for the death of the government the Founding Fathers designed. Going right to the scenes of the crimes, they dissect twelve of the most egregious assaults on the Constitution—some virtually unknown. In chronicling this “dirty dozen,” the authors show that the attacks began long before presidents declared preemptive wars, congresses built pork-barrel bridges to nowhere, and Supreme Court justices began to behave as our supreme legislators. In Who Killed the Constitution? Woods and Gutzman• REVEAL the federal government’s “great gold robbery”—the flagrant assault on the Constitution you never heard about in history class• DESTROY the phony case for presidential war power• EXPOSE how the federal government has actively discriminated to end . . . discrimination• TEAR DOWN the “wall of separation” between church and state—an invention that completely contradicts what the Constitution says• DARE to touch the “third rail of American jurisprudence,” Brown v. Board of Education—showing why a government decision that seems “right” isn’t necessarily constitutionalNever shying away from controversy, Woods and Gutzman reveal an unsettling but unavoidable truth: now that the federal government has broken free of the Constitution’s chains, government officials are restrained by little more than their sense of what they can get away with.Who Killed the Constitution? is a rallying cry for Americans outraged by government run amok and a warning to take heed before we lose the liberties we are truly entitled to.',19.31,'2006-12-15 00:00:00','Crown Forum','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320410930l/2191970.jpg'),('0ffb38e5-f515-4cb9-ac2b-d712d36b961a','The Jane Austen Book Club','Karen Joy Fowler',NULL,NULL,'The Extraordinary New York Times Bestseller  In California s central valley, five women and one man join to discuss Jane Austen s novels.

Much of the bombing was carried out against the expressed demands of the Allied military leadership. Hundreds of thousands of people died needlessly. Focusing on the crucial period from 1942 to 1945, and using a compelling narrative approach, Fire and Fury tells the story of the American and British bombing campaign through the eyes of those involved: military and civilian command in America, Britain, and Germany, aircrew in the sky, and civilians on the ground.Acclaimed historian Randall Hansen shows that the Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command, Arthur Harris, was wedded to an outdated strategy whose success had never been proven; how area bombing not only failed to win the war, it probably prolonged it; and that the US campaign, which was driven by a particularly American fusion of optimism and morality, played an important and largely unrecognized role in delivering Allied victory.From the Hardcover edition.',14.58,'1997-02-26 00:00:00','Anchor Canada','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320393059l/7290754.jpg'),('15e9e66f-9db7-4956-8647-ffd8c88843f5','Wayfarer','R.J.

Extensive scientific testing has been completed to authenticate the manuscript and ascertain its origins, and experts agree that it was written between 1853 and 1859, by an African-American woman who had previously been enslaved. Gates has painstakingly sought to identify the author, Hannah Crafts, through historical research, and although he has been unsuccessful in determining her true identity, he has found that many of the places, dates, and characters in the novel can be linked reliably to real events and people.A riveting story about a young slave woman on a Southern plantation, The Bondwoman s Narrative follows the title character as she escapes and makes her way to freedom. As a novel, it possesses all the charms and devices of popular mid-19th-century fiction, and the influences of gothic and romantic writers popular in the day are apparent throughout the text. But Crafts accomplishes more than mere mimicry in her book, adding her own voice to established traditions to create a unique style.Throughout the 19th century, many slave narratives -- most notably The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass -- detailed the daily horrors of slavery. In choosing to write a novel rather than an autobiographical narrative, however, Crafts expresses the complete psychological and emotional breadth of the experience, transcending personal, private tortures to illuminate the inhumanity of \"the peculiar institution.\" Her characters reflect upon and feel the experience of enslavement -- and because they are wholly rounded and fully developed, they also express the intellect and insight present in the best writings of Dickens, Poe, or Thoreau.Discovered dallying in her master s portrait gallery by a white housekeeper, who comments that she is \"[l]ooking at the pictures...as if such an ignorant thing as you would know any thing about them,\" the title character poignantly counters to herself, \"Ignorance, forsooth. Can ignorance quench the immortal mind or prevent its feeling at times the indications of its heavenly origins? Can it destroy that deep abiding appreciation of the beautiful that seems inherent to the human soul? Can it seal up the fountains of truth and all intuitive perception of life, death, and eternity? I think not. Those to whom man teaches little, nature like a wise and prudent mother teaches much.\"Regardless of its historical importance -- and the unavoidable questions and controversies about its authenticity -- the literary merits of The Bondwoman s Narrative are clear. A deeply engaging novel told with the clarity of a woman who has endured slavery s sorrows and the creativity of one who, at her core, was a gifted artist, it is a powerful story that leaves the reader simultaneously bereft and exhilarated, one that bears witness to the transcendent power of art.

Burroughs from St. Louis, stabbed a man named David Kammerer with a Boy Scout knife and threw his body in the Hudson River. For eight years, Kammerer had fawned over the younger Carr, but that night something happened: either Carr had had enough or he was forced to defend himself.The next day, his clothes stained with blood, Carr went to his friends Bill Burroughs and Jack Kerouac for help. Doing so, he involved them in the crime. A few months later, they were caught up in the crime in a different way. Something about the murder captivated the Beats, especially Kerouac and Burroughs, who decided to collaborate on a novel about the events of the previous summer. At the time, the two authors were still unknown, yet to write anything of note. Narrating alternating chapters, they pieced together a hard-boiled tale of bohemian New York during World War II, full of drugs and art, obsession and violence, with scenes and characters drawn from their own lives.They submitted their manuscript—called And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks after an absurd line from a radio bulletin about a circus fire—to publishers, but it was rejected and confined to a filing cabinet for decades. Finally published, at long last, And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks tells the story of Ramsay Allen and the object of his fixation, the charismatic, idealistic young Phillip Tourian. Phillip and his friends drink and dream in the bars and apartments of the West Village, until, with his friend Mike Ryko (Kerouac s narrator), he hatches a plan to ship out as a merchant marine. They ll catch a boat for France and jump ship, then make their way through the front to Paris. And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks is an engaging, fast-paced read that shows the two authors  developing styles.

Rappaport s spare, gripping text and Collier s distinctive collage-and-watercolor illustrations depict King s life journey with reverence and dignity -- beginning with his childhood experience of seeing \"White Only\" signs throughout his hometown, presenting his efforts as a civil rights crusader, and ending abruptly with his assassination. The front cover of the book immediately conveys King s power and spiritual strength, consisting entirely of a lifelike portrait of him -- the title and the author s and illustrator s names are relegated to the back cover. As Collier says in his illustrator s note, he \"tried to push [the imagery] to an emotional level that allows the reader to bring his or her own experience to it, without actually losing the intensity or the intention of the story.\" His technique is utterly effective. By using simple, direct language -- much of it King s -- the text offers young readers an accessible yet profound introduction to King s legacy. It explains that as a child, he listened to his minister father s \"big words\" and vowed to inspire others with such words when he grew up. The book s final sentence: \"His big words are alive for us today,\" testifies to King s success -- and to the timeless importance of this great leader s ideals. As further inspiration for interested readers, Martin s Big Words includes a list of significant dates as well as a bibliography of resources for them to explore.

Hurtful and dishonest, such representations force African American women to navigate a virtual crooked room that shames them and shapes their experiences as citizens. Many respond by assuming a mantle of strength that may convince others, and even themselves, that they do not need help. But as a result, the unique political issues of black women are often ignored and marginalized.In this groundbreaking book, Melissa V. Harris-Perry uses multiple methods of inquiry, including literary analysis, political theory, focus groups, surveys, and experimental research, to understand more deeply black women s political and emotional responses to pervasive negative race and gender images. Not a traditional political science work concerned with office-seeking, voting, or ideology, Sister Citizen instead explores how African American women understand themselves as citizens and what they expect from political organizing. Harris-Perry shows that the shared struggle to preserve an authentic self and secure recognition as a citizen links together black women in America, from the anonymous survivors of Hurricane Katrina to the current First Lady of the United States.',15.15,'2016-03-08 00:00:00','Yale University Press','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328847991l/11099156.jpg'),('42feef6f-b20d-44d2-9869-c36c67160213','The Devil Inside','Jenna Black','Morgan Kingsley ',1,'Possession.

Three years ago, Emmy Everett made the painful decision to call off her engagement and leave New York City behind. Since then she has been hiding out in Rhode Island working at a bait and tackle shop and haphazardly shooting a documentary about fishermen s wives. July 4th weekend has rolled around again and Emmy is mustering up the courage to return home to New York (the site of her own failed romance) to celebrate her brother Josh s wedding.  En route to his bachelor party, Emmy is shocked when her typically resolute brother confesses that he is having serious doubts about getting married and he may even be in love with another woman.  Emmy is determined to help her brother face up to this decision the one she fled from herself. With less than twenty-four hours to go before the wedding, she takes Josh on a road trip to find this mystery woman.

His theory of the “born” criminal dominated discussions of criminology in Europe and the Americas from the 1880s into the early twentieth century. His book, La donna delinquente, originally published in Italian in 1893, was the first and most influential book ever written on women and crime. This comprehensive new translation gives readers a full view of his landmark work.Lombroso’s research took him to police stations, prisons, and madhouses where he studied the tattoos, cranial capacities, and sexual behavior of criminals and prostitutes to establish a female criminal type. Criminal Woman, the Prostitute, and the Normal Woman anticipated today’s theories of genetic criminal behavior.

His theories, which the French press has termed \"l hypothèse girardienne,\" have sparked interdisciplinary, even international, controversy. In The Scapegoat, Girard applies his approach to \"texts of persecution,\" documents that recount phenomena of collective violence from the standpoint of the persecutor--documents such as the medieval poet Guillaume de Machaut s Judgement of the King of Navarre, which blames the Jews for the Black Death and describes their mass murder.Girard compares persecution texts with myths, most notably with the myth of Oedipus, and finds strikingly similar themes and structures. Could myths regularly conceal texts of persecution? Girard s answers lies in a study of the Christian Passion, which represents the same central event, the same collective violence, found in all mythology, but which is read from the point of view of the innocent victim. The Passion text provides the model interpretation that has enabled Western culture to demystify its own violence--a demystification Girard now extends to mythology.Underlying Girard s daring textual hypothesis is a powerful theory of history and culture. Christ s rejection of all guilt breaks the mythic cycle of violence and the sacred. The scapegoat becomes the Lamb of God; \"the foolish genesis of blood-stained idols and the false gods of superstition, politics, and ideologies\" are revealed.',18.61,'1992-01-21 00:00:00','Johns Hopkins University Press','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348981440l/604562.jpg'),('5cc8a3d4-e954-4e86-8926-0381b7eb6855','Sex Wars: A Novel of Gilded Age New York','Marge Piercy',NULL,NULL,'Post–Civil War New York City is the battleground of the American dream.

The author demonstrates that much of the moral philosophy, legal theory, and animal advocacy aimed at advancing nonhuman emancipation actually perpetuate speciesism. Speciesism examines philosophy, law, and activism in terms of three categories: \"old speciesism,\" \"new speciesism,\" and species equality.Old-speciesists limit rights to humans. Speciesism refutes their standard arguments against nonhuman rights. Current law is old-speciesist -- legally, nonhumans have no rights. Dunayer shows that \"animal laws\" such as the Humane Slaughter Act afford nonhumans no meaningful protection. She also explains why welfarist campaigns are old-speciesist. Instead of opposing the abuse or killing of nonhuman beings, such campaigns seek only to make abuse or killing less cruel; they propose alternative ways of violating nonhumans  moral rights. Many organizations that consider themselves animal rights advocates engage in old-speciesist campaigns, which reinforce the property status of nonhumans rather than promoting their emancipation.New-speciesists espouse rights for only some nonhumans, those whose minds seem most like those of humans. In addition to devaluing most animals, new-speciesists give greater moral consideration and stronger basic rights to humans than they do to any nonhumans. They see animalkind as a hierarchy, with humans at the top. Dunayer explains why she categorizes such theorists as Peter Singer, Tom Regan, and Steven Wise as new-speciesists.Nonspeciesists advocaterights for every sentient being. Speciesism makes the case that every creature with a nervous system should be regarded as sentient. The book provides compelling evidence of consciousness in animals often dismissed as insentient -- such as fishes, insects, spiders, and snails. Dunayer argues that every sentient being should possess basic legal rights, including rights to life and liberty.

The first memoir ever published by a USS Arizona survivor.At 8:10 a.m. on December 7, 1941, Seaman First Class Donald Stratton was consumed by an inferno. A million pounds of explosives had detonated beneath his battle station aboard the USS Arizona, barely fifteen minutes into Japan’s surprise attack on American forces at Pearl Harbor. Near death and burned across two thirds of his body, Don, a nineteen-year-old Nebraskan who had been steeled by the Great Depression and Dust Bowl, summoned the will to haul himself hand over hand across a rope tethered to a neighboring vessel. Forty-five feet below, the harbor’s flaming, oil-slick water boiled with enemy bullets; all around him the world tore itself apart.In this extraordinary, never-before-told eyewitness account of the Pearl Harbor attack—the only memoir ever written by a survivor of the USS Arizona—ninety-four-year-old veteran Donald Stratton finally shares his unforgettable personal tale of bravery and survival on December 7, 1941, his harrowing recovery, and his inspiring determination to return to the fight.Don and four other sailors made it safely across the same line that morning, a small miracle on a day that claimed the lives of 1,177 of their Arizona shipmates—approximately half the American fatalaties at Pearl Harbor. Sent to military hospitals for a year, Don refused doctors’ advice to amputate his limbs and battled to relearn how to walk. The U.S. Navy gave him a medical discharge, believing he would never again be fit for service, but Don had unfinished business. In June 1944, he sailed back into the teeth of the Pacific War on a destroyer, destined for combat in the crucial battles of Leyte Gulf, Luzon, and Okinawa, thus earning the distinction of having been present for the opening shots and the final major battle of America’s Second World War.As the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack approaches, Don, a great-grandfather of five and one of six living survivors of the Arizona, offers an unprecedentedly intimate reflection on the tragedy that drew America into the greatest armed conflict in history.

Lepidus has retreated to Africa, while Antony rules the opulent East, and Octavian claims the West, the heart of Rome, as his domain. Though this tense truce holds civil war at bay, Rome seems ripe for an emperor -- a true Julian heir to lay claim to Caesar s legacy. With the bearing of a hero, and the riches of the East at his disposal, Antony seems poised to take the prize. Like a true warrior-king, he is a seasoned general whose lust for power burns alongside a passion for women, feasts, and Chian wine. His rival, Octavian, seems a less convincing candidate: the slight, golden-haired boy is as controlled as Antony is indulgent and as cool-headed and clear-eyed as Antony is impulsive. Indeed, the two are well matched only in ambition.And though politics and war are decidedly the provinces of men in ancient Rome, women are adept at using their wits and charms to gain influence outside their traditional sphere. Cleopatra, the ruthless, golden-eyed queen, welcomes Antony to her court and her bed but keeps her heart well guarded. A ruler first and a woman second, Cleopatra has but one desire: to place her child on his father, Julius Caesar s, vacant throne. Octavian, too, has a strong woman by his side: his exquisite wife, raven-haired Livia Drusilla, who learns to wield quiet power to help her husband in his quest for ascendancy. As the plot races toward its inevitable conclusion -- with battles on land and sea -- conspiracy and murder, love and politics become irrevocably entwined.McCullough s knowledge of Roman history is detailed and extensive.

Some system of authority is a requirement of all communal living, and it is only the man dwelling in isolation who is not forced to respond, through defiance or submission, to the commands of others. Obedience, as a determinant of behavior is of particular relevance to our time. It has been reliably established that from 1933 to 1945 millions of innocent people were systematically slaughtered on command. Gas chambers were built, death camps were guarded, daily quotas of corpses were produced with the same efficiency as the manufacture of appliances. These inhumane policies may have originated in the mind of a single person, but they could only have been carried out on a massive scale if a very large number of people obeyed orders.Obedience is the psychological mechanism that links individual action to political purpose. It is the dispositional cement that binds men to systems of authority. Facts of recent history and observation in daily life suggest that for many people obedience may be a deeply ingrained behavior tendency, indeed, a prepotent impulse overriding training in ethics, sympathy, and moral conduct. C. P. Snow (1961) points to its importance when he writes:When you think of the long and gloomy history of man, you will find more hideous crimes have been committed in the name of obedience than have ever been committed in the name of rebellion. If you doubt that, read William Sbirer s  Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.  The German Officer Corps were brought up in the most rigorous code of obedience . . . in the name of obedience they were party to, andassisted in, the most wicked large scale actions in the history of the world. (p. 24)The Nazi extermination of European Jews is the most extremeinstance of abhorrent immoral acts carried out by thousands ofpeople in the name of obedience. Yet in lesser degree this type ofthing is constantly recurring: ordinary citizens are ordered todestroy other people, and they do so because they consider ittheir duty to obey orders. Thus, obedience to authority, longpraised as a virtue, takes on a new aspect when it serves amalevolent cause; far from appearing as a virtue, it is transformedinto a heinous sin. Or is it?The moral question of whether one should obey when commands conflict with conscience was argued by Plato, dramatized in \"Antigone,\" and treated to philosophic analysis in every historical epoch Conservative philosophers argue that the very fabric of society is threatened by disobedience, and even when the act prescribed by an authority is an evil one, it is better to carry out the act than to wrench at the structure of authority. Hobbes stated further that an act so executed is in no sense the responsibility of the person who carries it out but only of the authority that orders it. But humanists argue for the primacy of individual conscience in such matters, insisting that the moral judgments of the individual must override authority when the two are in conflict.The legal and philosophic aspects of obedience are of enormous import, but an empirically grounded scientist eventually comes to the point where he wishes to move from abstract discourse to the careful observation of concrete instances. In order to take a close look at the act of obeying, I set up a simple experimentat Yale University. Eventually, the experiment was to involve more than a thousand participants and would be repeated at several universities, but at the beginning, the conception was simple. A person comes to a psychological laboratory and is told to carry out a series of acts that come increasingly into conflict with conscience. The main question is how far the participant will comply with the experimenter s instructions before refusing to carry out the actions required of him.But the reader needs to know a little more detail about the experiment. Two people come to a psychology laboratory to take part in a study of memory and learning. One of them is designated as a \"teacher\" and the other a \"learner.\" The experimenter explains that the study is concerned with the effects of punishment on learning. The learner is conducted into a room, seated in a chair, his arms strapped to prevent excessive movement, and an electrode attached to his wrist. He is told that he is to learn a list of word pairs; whenever he makes an error, be will receive electric shocks of increasing intensity.The real focus of the experiment is the teacher. After watching the learner being strapped into place, he is taken into the main experimental room and seated before an impressive shock generator. Its main feature is a horizontal line of thirty switches, ranging from 15 volts to 450 volts, in 15-volt increments. There are also verbal designations which range from Slight SHOCK to Danger--Severe SHOCK. The teacher is told that he is to administer the learning test to the man in the other room. When the learner responds correctly, the teacher moves on to the next item; when the other man gives an incorrectanswer, the teacher is to give him an electric shock. He is to start at the lowest shock level ( 15 volts) and to increase the level each time the man makes an error, going through 30 volts, 45 volts, and so on.The \"teacher\" is a genuinely naive subject who has come to the laboratory to participate in an experiment. The learner, or victim, is an actor who actually receives no shock at all. The point of the experiment is to see how far a person will proceed in a concrete and measurable situation in which he is ordered to inflict increasing pain on a protesting victim.',10.13,'1990-07-21 00:00:00','Harper Perennial','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403550976l/676723.jpg'),('8393dd2d-7580-4d79-ba1f-cdcf2ff586cb','Cursed','H.M.

The man is Hendrik Hofgen, a character actor who in his own life plays a bizarre part in the elite circle of the Third Reich. Hofgen is publicly a revolutionary, but secretly he is a man driven by an obsessive need for power and fame. Although he benefits from the prestige of being married to the daughter of an eminent politician, he endangers his rise in Nazi society by his compulsive involvement with ‘a black Venus.’ His brilliant success as Mephisto in FAUST brings him the support of the Führer’s prime minister, who appoints him head of the State Theater. His dreams are finally realized, but the story ends on a note of despair as Hofgen is forced to confront the emptiness of his life. Mann weaves his tale with amazing skill. The result is a fascinating novel of decadence and evil.Klaus Mann, the second child of Thomas Mann, was born in Munich in 1906.

When an elderly duke begins pursuing the disgraced Polly and a callow potential heir curries favor with her parents, nothing goes as expected, but in the end all find happiness in their own unconventional ways.',11.24,'2010-02-13 00:00:00','The Folio Society','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1219337277l/4331044.jpg'),('8fd2862f-344b-40b8-9809-b3faa2d588b0','A Fine Line: How Most American Kids Are Kept Out of the Best Public Schools','Gloria Romero',NULL,NULL,'WHAT SIDE OF THE LINE DO YOU LIVE ON?In 1954 the Supreme Court ruled that little Linda Brown couldn t be excluded from a public school because of her race. In that landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, the court famously declared that public education must be available to all on equal terms, but sixty-six years later, many of the best public schools remain closed to all but the most privileged families. Empowered by little-known state laws, school districts draw attendance zones around their best schools, indicating who is, and who isn t, allowed to enroll. In many American cities, this means that living on one side of the street or the other will determine whether you leave eighth grade on a track for future success or barely able to read.In A Fine Line, bestselling author Tim DeRoche takes a close look at the laws and policies that dictate which kids are allowed to go to which schools. And he finds surprising parallels between current education policies and the redlining practices of the New Deal era in which minority families were often denied mortgages and government housing assistance because they didn t live within certain desirable zones of the city. It is an extraordinary story of American democracy gone wrong that will make you question everything you think you know about our public education system.',15.14,'2016-06-05 00:00:00','Redtail Press','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1579530304l/40859234.jpg'),('904e41c7-5766-4dde-93e0-bce3950613e3','Release Me','J.

The Dance of Life reveals the ways in which individuals in culture are tied together by invisible threads of rhythm and yet isolated from each other by hidden walls of time.

Time plays a central role in the diversity of cultures such as the American and the Japanese, which Hall shows to be mirror images of each other. He also deals with how time influences relations among Western Europeans, Latin Americans, Anglo-Americans, and Native Americans.First published in 1983, this book studies how people are tied together and yet isolated by hidden threads of rhythm and walls of time.  Time is treated as a language, organizer, and message system revealing people s feelings about each other and reflecting differences between cultures.',14.07,'1996-07-04 00:00:00','Anchor','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1378321753l/906340.jpg'),('93794ca9-c657-4734-ab9f-033be0d9d4c4','Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH','Robert C.

An intricate detective story that at times tests the sanity of an original thinker who offers his full consciousness to bring this ambitious labor to a satisfying conclusion.” Lance Owens, host of gnosis.org   , “...very well written, extremely intriguing, and conveys a huge amount of information on Gospel criticism and Gnosticism. A remarkable, if mystifying, work!”  Robert M Price, author of The Reason Driven Life   “A moving story—I was glad to read it.”  Elaine Pagels, author of The Gnostic Gospels  “A powerful story of a grieving man s search for spiritual solace that touches deeply into our hearts. The introduction alone contains hidden treasures.”  Rosamonde Ikshvàku Miller, Gnostic Bishop   “Developing a book that shares many themes with Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code, Mr. Lie finds it perfectly normal to quote Richard Dawkins’ The God Delusion side by side with obscure apocryphal gospels and even sprinkles some biblical criticism worthy of Bart Ehrman on the top. Luckily, his indiscriminate borrowings don’t shatter the tubes and his experiment turns out to be exactly as intended: a fiendishly clever parody of conspiracy theories and the paranoia they breed.”  T. R. Demeglio, religious scholar and critic  In his last book, Joshua Lie examines how the Evangelists misquoted the Old Testament to prove Jesus was the Messiah and embarks on a journey where he misquotes the four Gospels themselves to advance a Jesus that no Christian has ever dreamt of.  The Nag Hammadi Library, the Gospel of Judas, the mysteries of the Manicheans and the Cathars, the alchemical endeavors of Carl Jung and the terrifying visions of Lovecraft and William Blake – all sources that he blends together to paint his personal savior.  Lie notices that many things attributed to Jesus in the bible make little sense and decides that the best way to pass his ideas is to offer them as new answers to old problems. By a sleight of hand, he offers shocking, yet convincing, explanations to some of the strangest things attributed to Jesus. We finally know why Jesus cursed the Canaanite woman, rebuked Mary at the wedding of Cana, and uttered his famous cry at the cross: ‘God why have you forsaken me?’  Lie pretends to adopt the Gnostic exegesis of the bible, which maintains that Jesus was a divine being who descended to the earth to save his fallen lover Sophia. Lie argues that Jesus’ entire mission was one of spiritual wedding and claims that all the women that Jesus encountered in the Gospels were allegorical for Sophia, each representing her in one of the stages of her spiritual development.  And so Lie proceeds, following the steps of Jesus till the moment when the redeemer, crucified, hugs Sophia and submits his spirit in her embrace. A minor mistake, however, reveals the entire work to be the product of his grievance at the loss of his granddaughter. Sadly, it is at this tragic moment that his gospel comes to an abrupt end; for Lie, unable to comprehend the mystery of the resurrection and experience the solace it brings, abandons his draft to finally wither and die.  This could have very well been the end of Lie’s tragic story, were it not for his good friend Fady Riad who discovers the manuscript and takes an oath upon himself to have it completed and published.  “Your book will be finished, and your Jesus will be resurrected.” He promises his friend in a dream.  As Riad studies the draft, however, he soon realizes that it is riddled with various loose ends that make completing it virtually impossible. Nonetheless, Riad doesn’t give up, knowing that there is no price that he won’t pay to honor the legacy of his late friend...',12.25,'2009-02-26 00:00:00','Abraxas House','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1491524969l/34814551._SY475_.jpg'),('9fa7cac8-cf96-49a8-8b5e-38c2de9dc53a','The Heart of Arcrea','Nicole Sager','The Arcrean Conquest ',1,'“He who discovers the heart of Arcrea and joins the hands of the seven regions will be king.” Set during a forgotten age of kings and queens, knights and nobles, wise-men and warlords, The Heart of Arcrea follows the story of Druet the blacksmith, who, hoping to free his father from an unjust imprisonment, sets out on a quest that will solve an ancient riddle and crown a man as Arcrea’s first king.

Although the basic notion dates back to the days of Socrates, there is still heated disagreement about the nature of truth, reality, knowledge, the good, and God. This may make little practical difference to our lives, but it leaves us with a feeling of radical uncertainty, a feeling described by Kolakowski as \"metaphysical horror.\" \"The horror is this,\" he says, \"if nothing truly exists except the Absolute, the Absolute is nothing; if nothing truly exists except myself, I am nothing.\" The aim of this book, for Kolakowski, is finding a way out of this seeming dead end.In a trenchant analysis that serves as an introduction to nearly all of Western philosophy, Kolakowski confronts these dilemmas head on through examinations of several prominent philosophers including Descartes, Spinoza, Husserl, and many of the Neo-Platonists. He finds that philosophy may not provide definitive answers to the fundamental questions, yet the quest itself transforms our lives. It may undermine most of our certainties, yet it still leaves room for our spiritual yearnings and religious beliefs.The final sentence of the book captures the hopefulness that has survived the horror of nothingness when Kolakowski asks: \"Is it not reasonable to suspect that if existence were pointless and the universe devoid of meaning, we would never have achieved not only the ability to imagine otherwise, but even the ability to entertain this very thought—to wit, that existence is pointless and the universe devoid of meaning?\" The answer, of course, is clear.

She’s convinced she’ll be the one to break through the woman’s silence. Winning Miss Rabbit’s trust doesn’t come easy. Overprotective parents, a drill sergeant of a Head Nurse, and a chain-smoking geriatric busybody offer little in the way of help. Sophie’s entire strategy hinges on advice from an unnerving observer – one pesky know-it-all woman, come back from the dead to assist. Her unexpected gift propels Sophie on a journey through a past no one is willing to claim and a reality no one should ever know. As Sophie learns that love often hides behind difficult choices, she tries to help Miss Rabbit find her voice, and in doing so, discovers her own.Showcasing the heart of one generation and the soul of another, THE SECRET MISS RABBIT KEPT is ripe with poignancy and humor. A story of unexpected friendships and second chances, this coming-of-age tale proves that growing up and growing old aren’t so different after all.',17.95,'2001-03-25 00:00:00','Empty Nest Publications','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383807269l/18758062.jpg'),('b7c3f60d-c241-4aed-be3c-c748fef5b64b','The Wounded Heart','Larry Crabb',NULL,NULL,'Sexual abuse not only destroys trust, relationships, and dreams, it also causes grief, stress, and feelings of guilt and shame.

Letter to a Christian Nation. Bestseller lists are filled with doubters. But what happens when you actually doubt your doubts?Although a vocal minority continues to attack the Christian faith, for most Americans, faith is a large part of their lives: 86 percent of Americans refer to themselves as religious, and 75 percent of all Americans consider themselves Christians. So how should they respond to these passionate, learned, and persuasive books that promote science and secularism over religion and faith? For years, Tim Keller has compiled a list of the most frequently voiced “doubts” skeptics bring to his Manhattan church. And in The Reason for God, he single-handedly dismantles each of them. Written with atheists, agnostics, and skeptics in mind, Keller also provides an intelligent platform on which true believers can stand their ground when bombarded by the backlash. The Reason for God challenges such ideology at its core and points to the true path and purpose of Christianity.Why is there suffering in the world? How could a loving God send people to Hell? Why isn’t Christianity more inclusive? Shouldn’t the Christian God be a god of love? How can one religion be “right” and the rest “wrong”? Why have so many wars been fought in the name of God? These are just a few of the questions even ardent believers wrestle with today. In this book, Tim Keller uses literature, philosophy, real-life conversations and reasoning, and even pop culture to explain how faith in a Christian God is a soundly rational belief, held by thoughtful people of intellectual integrity with a deep compassion for those who truly want to know the truth.',10.07,'2012-05-11 00:00:00','Dutton','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388185497l/1858013.jpg'),('d138ecc7-706c-41b6-a4fa-cc1af95e28e4','All That Glitters','Rachel Roberts','Avalon: Web of Magic ',2,'\n  \n    Emily and Adriane each have one thing Kara lacks—a magic gem.

For the ups and downs between Holmes and Chadwick are due to something more than the occasional clash of demanding, eccentric personalities.

Knowing he eschews matters of the heart, however, she struggles to hide it, in order to maintain the friendship they do have, preferring said friendship to total alienation. Holmes also feels attraction - but fights it tooth and nail, refusing to admit to the fact, even to himself. After all, it is not merely Skye s work the spies may be after - but her life as well.

Though he was born in New York, the family had returned to Ireland due to poor prospects in the United States. Now back on American soil, this awkward 19-year-old, with his \"pimply face, sore eyes, and bad teeth,\" has little in common with the healthy, self-assured college students he sees on the subway and dreams of joining in the classroom. Initially, his American experience is as harrowing as his impoverished youth in Ireland, including two of the grimmest Christmases ever described in literature. McCourt views the U.S. through the same sharp eye and with the same dark humor that distinguished his first memoir: race prejudice, casual cruelty, and dead-end jobs weigh on his spirits as he searches for a way out. A glimpse of hope comes from the army, where he acquires some white-collar skills, and from New York University, which admits him without a high school diploma. But the journey toward his position teaching creative writing at Stuyvesant High School is neither quick nor easy. Fortunately, McCourt s openness to every variety of human emotion and longing remains exceptional; even the most damaged, difficult people he encounters are richly rendered individuals with whom the reader can t help but feel uncomfortable kinship. The magical prose, with its singing Irish cadences, brings grandeur and beauty to the most sorrowful events, including the final scene, set in a Limerick graveyard. --Wendy Smith',16.33,'2006-01-05 00:00:00','Flamingo','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1375947803l/4912.jpg'),('e386249c-ee74-4112-b7c9-af5d4380e5ad','Immortality','Peter Kussi',NULL,NULL,'This breathtaking, reverberating survey of human nature finds Kundera still attempting to work out the meaning of life, without losing his acute sense of humour.

Offered by her noble family to the Church at the age of eight, she lived for years in forced silence. But through the study of books and herbs, through music and the kinship of her church sisters, Hildegard found her way from a life of submission to a calling that celebrated the divine mother and the glories all around us.

These texts supply evidence crucial to an understanding of the bizarre mix of Quranic scholarship, CIA training, punctual interventions in Gulf politics and messianic anti-imperialism that has formed the programmatic core of Al Qaeda.In bringing together the various statements issued under bin Laden’s name since 1994, this volume forms part of a growing discourse that seeks to demythologize the terrorist network. Newly translated from the Arabic, annotated with a critical introduction by Islamic scholar Bruce Lawrence, this collection places the statements in their religious, historical and political context. It shows how bin Laden’s views draw on and differ from other strands of radical Islamic thought; it also demonstrates how his arguments vary in degrees of consistency, and how his evasions concerning the true nature and extent of his own group, and over his own role in terrorist attacks, have contributed to the perpetuation of his personal mythology.',16.7,'1998-05-19 00:00:00','Verso','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1373998533l/307962.jpg'),('fd875afd-4829-4753-9a7d-60926ad30d0b','The Immoralist','Alan Sheridan',NULL,NULL,'In \n  The Immoralist\n, André Gide presents the confessional account of a man seeking the truth of his own nature.

It s a surprisingly uninspiring short story about an apparently very conflicted woman being forced into the company of the man she had walked out on the day before their wedding, many years earlier.This book was a freebie, but even at that price I m ambivalent as to whether or not it was worth it.  The female lead character, Kasie, was unremarkable, and seemed to obsess on imaginary conflict where none existed.  The male lead, Chayton, was not much stronger.  I found it annoying that he demanded that Kasie cook and work around the cabin when he had kidnapped her and held her at his snowed-in cabin against her will. He seemed to think that her initial refusal to \"pull  her weight\" made her a brat, but it was actually her repeated complaints about her parents  trying to \"control her life\" that made her a whiny brat.Kasie s weak character was more and more annoying as the book went on, but when she finally meets up with her father after many years of estrangement, she acts almost as though her total lack of contact never happened.  If she was that annoyed over all those years about her father \"controlling her,\" she would not have been able to warm up to him or his new wife that quickly.  Basically, the author manufactured Kasie s feeling she was \"controlled\" by her parents to create some sort of tension in the story, a conflict to be overcome, but it s just too contrived to be believable.The ending was awkward, with Chayton suddenly acting entirely out of character compared to how he behaved in the prior 95% of the book, with no explanation for why he changed so dramatically from one scene to the next.  And what 26 year old woman is still a virgin, especially when she is supposedly about to marry a famous, handsome rock star, and who thinks she would prefer to just live with him instead?  The author seemed to require that Kasie remain chaste all those years away after she left Chayton and her father, however it was fine that Chayton had had \"his share of flings!\"  The old double standard - reinforced by a modern day female author.  Wow.','2020-09-01 22:24:25','available'),('24d88178-71bb-4ca9-ab18-5b0dcb62de01','020a6a26-6296-4a96-95b1-eb97858acc04','4098c86e-ed74-4c89-aa51-f4beac98421b','That is exactly what was done by the author.

Rae is a girl training to become a Cleric until one day she discovers she is a fairy. So, starts this book. The entire storyline takes place in 2 days but, oh boy! does a lot happen in 2 days. Rae is thrust into a war between 2 fairy factions, 2 love interests (the fairy named Breandan and the vampire named Tomas) and so on...I found the idea of the story interesting. This book does have some potential IF some very big issues are addressed.Grammar: If there was ever a book in need of an edit, this is the one. The grammatical errors, missing words, wrong words (at one point the author writes `right  when it should have been `wrong ), etc. made reading the book so distracting and frustrating that I could barely concentrate on the plot. I don t think I went 2 pages without encountering a mistake.Character development: Characters are largely undeveloped and have no depth, even the main ones. For example, we get very little in terms of interaction between Rae and her best friend Alex, so the events of the end did not have any effect on me whatsoever. We didn t get to care about Alex at all. We learned little about her, and only through Rae s narration. Basically, that is the problem, we learned everything from the author telling us than from the character development.Character interaction: I will make allowances for Rae s sudden trusting happy lovey dovey relationship with Breandan but, not with Tomas. We get no frame of reference, rhyme or reason as to why Rae is interacting with the vampire Tomas the way she is. From their first encounter to the second, there is a world of difference. I mean, talk about jumping the gun!Basically, this is a story with potential if the author decides to review it and expand on the book, fix the errors and get a good editor. Also, am I missing a chapter between 9 and 10? :/ That was a BIG jump in events.','2020-02-16 07:33:52','available'),('e7acc7b0-1143-4a22-b782-caa512139e11','020a6a26-6296-4a96-95b1-eb97858acc04','56c50e1c-1a50-4d24-87e9-c2c09c1a2a8a','I should have stopped reading when I read Keep on Truckin by Al Green.

I already read this before but I just had to read this again. Jake is Emily s boss. He is ruthless in business. When it comes to his women, although not exactly the love them and leave them kind of guy, he does not allow any of them in his heart. Enters Emily, his personal assistant. A shy and seemingly unattractive woman. When Jake makes it his business to do a makeover for Emily and to teach her how to flirt and how to act on dates, it is a disaster and heartbreak just waiting to happen since both of them eventually realize that they feel something for the other.
